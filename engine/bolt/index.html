BOLT is an algorithmic accelerator for training deep learning models that can achieve or surpass GPU performance on commodity CPU hardware. It doesn’t use specialized instructions, and you can add it to your existing machine learning pipelines with just a few lines of code.\nWhy BOLT? We built BOLT to solve a simple problem: deep learning models are only getting bigger, and big models are expensive to train. In 2020, OpenAI’s 175-billion parameter GPT-3 model rocked the machine learning community with its impressive performance on a wide array of NLP tasks. Not to be outdone, other companies and institutions have followed OpenAI’s lead. There are already five or six other models as large or larger than GPT-3.\nHowever, such massive models require ever more computation and are trained on clusters of GPUs for months at a time. In the case of GPT-3, for instance, the electricity cost of training alone was reported to be $12 million. These sorts of resources are infeasible for all but the largest companies, leaving progress along this path out of reach for almost everyone.\nEnter BOLT:\n BOLT makes training more computationally efficient, reducing both the barrier to entry and the environmental impact of machine learning BOLT can turn idling, commodity servers into machine learning powerhouses, increasing utilization of cloud and edge compute BOLT allows you to train models wherever your data is, whether that’s your laptop or even your raspberry pi  If you’re interested, you can demo BOLT here.\nHow does BOLT work? BOLT relies on a phenomenon that naturally occurs in our brains: sparse coding. Sparse coding refers to the tendency of mammalian brains to activate only a small number of locally-clustered neurons in response to a given stimuli, despite each neuron being able to activate possibly thousands of other neurons distributed across the entire brain. Thus, only a tiny fraction of available neurons are actually activated, leading to the stimuli being represented as a highly-efficient, “sparse” coding. You can imagine a stimulus traveling through the brain’s neural network in real-time, neurons firing a few at a time. Although each neuron is connected to thousands of other neurons, only a few of the neurons adjacent to an active neuron will fire in turn.\nTraditional computational neural networks eschew sparse coding. During training and inference, these models update the weight between every pair of neurons. This is analagous to every neuron in our brain being activated in response to every stimulus. That’s a lot of unnecessary work, and it’s really only feasible on GPUs which can perform very fast matrix multiplication operations.\nApplying sparse coding to computational neural networks isn’t a completely new idea. But initial, naive implementations weren’t efficient enough to beat GPUs computing all the weights of densely-connected networks, so sparse coding was written off as a cutting edge, but not quite practical, approach to improving the efficiency of models. Until recently, it was an open question as to whether sparse coding would ever be feasible.\nBOLT settles this debate by providing an effective deep learning library powered by sparse coding. Following in the footsteps of recent academic systems like SLIDE, BOLT manipulates how the parameters of a neural network are organized and accessed in memory using a technique called locality sensitive hashing.\nUltimately, BOLT can get away with training an entire model through a small number of hash computations followed by a few irregular memory accesses and a tiny amount of traditional machine learning arithmetic. We’ve bundled these operations into an easy-to-use and efficient package for accelerating deep learning networks.\nBenchmarking BOLT To benchmark BOLT, we trained two networks: one fully-connected network with a 256-dimensional hidden layer (200 million parameters) and one fully connected network with a 2000-dimensional hidden layer (1.6 billion parameters). For a task representative of several industry-scale applications, we choose the Amazon 670K Kaggle dataset.\nWe trained both BOLT and TensorFlow using a 2021 Apple M1 Macbook Air and a single refurbished BLADE node (each of these machines costs less than $1,500). For comparison, we trained an identical model using TensorFlow on a state-of-the-art A100 GPU (which is almost 10x the price of the other machines).\nOur findings are summarized in the accuracy versus time graphs below, which speak for themselves:\nPrecision@1 measures how often the highest-ranked document retrieved by the model is relevant.\n We achieve 0.25 precision with BOLT on an Intel CPU over 4 times faster than TensorFlow on an A100 GPU. We achieve 0.25 precision with BOLT on an Intel CPU 8 times faster than TensorFlow on an Intel CPU.  BTW: Our goal at ThirdAI is to make training deep learning models fast, efficient, and accessible. If that sounds fun, we’re hiring.\n",
