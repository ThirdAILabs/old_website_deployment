And as model sizes continue to grow, their associated environmental costs begin to burgeon. But how does BOLT&amp;mdash;and more broadly, sparsity&amp;mdash;translate into carbon savings?
Inspiration After reading Etsy&amp;rsquo;s Cloud Jewels blog post, I was curious to see if we could replicate their methodology to ballpark the carbon footprint required to train a model with BOLT at different levels of sparsity.</description></item></channel></rss>
